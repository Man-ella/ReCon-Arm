# ReCon-Arm
This project focuses on demonstrating reduction/elimination in singularities and improvement in workspace of a conventional 3R positional manipulator for robotic welding applications. In robotic arc welding, 3R serial structures are widely used for positioning the torch near the weld seam.
Conventional 3R positioning configurations suffer from kinematic singularities (e.g., elbow/shoulder alignment), causing:

1. Loss of effective DOF and poor controllability
2. Motion interruptions or erratic joint speeds
3. Difficulties tracking long, smooth weld paths

Our problem: Can we modify existing 3R configuration to reduce the practical impact of these singularities and extend the reachable weld region without completely redesigning industrial arms?

Prior Approaches to solving problem
Kinematic Redundancy & Redundancy resolution
Variable-geometry manipulators (telescoping links).
Path planning algorithms to bypass singular regions

Gap: Less attention to minimal structural modifications to a 3R chain specifically for welding-style paths.
